Meeting with Jim:
- Give feedback to the player in a cool way when they doo something, like camera zooms over to robot as he roars.
- Manage entities better than just huge lists
- possibly change screws to be from the same class with that strategy he mentions i forgot the name of
- Cool boss AI, not simple stuff. It's got to be rewarding and exciting to player

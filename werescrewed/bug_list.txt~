BUG LIST:
Done?(x)	Found By	Squashed by	Description
	 x		Stew		Stew		Players fall through one-sides platforms when skeletons move up/down too fast because player goes slightly under the platform which then turns off the contact listener i think.
     x      Anders      Anders      The asset manager does not work for android because everyone is using direct paths rather than relative, because android has a different path.
            Anders                  Jumping when off the screen allows for infinite jumping when holding grab. 
            Anders                  Jumping up through a one sided platform sends the player higher then usual, is jump being reset?
	 x	    Kevin       Kevin       Level is completely broken by the new AssetManager code. It seems like the asset manager is created after the Level is or something, leading to a null pointer exception.
     x      Kevin		Kevin		I think I've finally squashed the infinite-jump bug once-and-for-all. Jump() now sets the player to be ungrounded, regardless of other circumstances. 
	                                Screw jumping is unaffected, since it doesn't care whether the player is grounded or not, but now the player can, at worst, only jump in mid-air once.
